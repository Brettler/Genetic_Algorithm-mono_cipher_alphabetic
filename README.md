# Genetic_Algorithm-mono_cipher_alphabetic

Here we provide a detailed explanation of how to execute our program.
Please note, that the program is only compatible with Windows operating systems,
and be aware that your antivirus software may issue a warning that the file contains a virus.
Rest assured, the only "virus" contained within the file is Darwin (we prefer and love Lamarck).

1. Download the program from the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YaHCX_xAMtxvP2NEufb7nlOeDAoPTB-K?usp=sharing
2. To execute the program, double-click on the 'gui.exe' file.
3. Please wait for the program to load.
4. Switch the txt file inputs we provided with your own files.
	The ‘enc.txt’ file must be replaced with the file you wish to decipher.
	The 'true_perm.txt' file must contain the true permutation of the encryption in the format required in the task instructions.
	This field is not mandatory, allowing the algorithm to run without it. Submission of the file will allow the algorithm to calculate
	the accuracy of the results.
5. Choose your favorite optimization (our recommendation: Lamarck).
6. Press 'Run' and enjoy the show.
7. Once the algorithm comes to a stop and outputs the results, you may run it again as you choose.

For more information about the program itself, please refer to the accompanying PDF file.
Additionally, we made a short YouTube tutorial demonstrating the use of the program:
